Here you may find code for solving different OpenAI gym environments, https://gym.openai.com/users/404akhan

Currently solved:

Cartpole-V1 - by implementing deep q learning https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf

LunarLander-V2 - by implementing policy gradient which partially used code from blog http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl

Pendulum-V0 - by implementing deep deterministic policy gradient, which suits for continuous action spaces https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971
